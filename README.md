- "C" clears the display and resets calculator state
- "¬±" toggles the sign of the current number
- "%" converts the current number to percentage

#### **NPV Mode**
1. Enter **Discount Rate** as percentage (e.g., 10 for 10%)
2. Input **Cash Flows** separated by commas (e.g., -1000, 300, 400, 500)
   - First value typically represents initial investment (negative)
   - Subsequent values represent future cash inflows
3. Click **"Calculate NPV"** for comprehensive results including:
   - Net Present Value
   - Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
   - Payback Period

#### **DCF Mode**
1. Enter **Free Cash Flows** separated by commas (projected annual FCF)
2. Set **Terminal Growth Rate** as percentage (long-term growth assumption)
3. Input **Discount Rate/WACC** as percentage
4. Click **"Calculate DCF"** for enterprise valuation including:
   - Present Value of projected cash flows
   - Terminal value and its present value
   - Total enterprise value

#### **Cash Flow Mode**
1. Enter **Initial Cash Flow** amount in dollars
2. Set **Annual Growth Rate** as percentage
3. Specify **Number of Years** for projection
4. Click **"Project Cash Flows"** for detailed analysis:
   - Year-by-year cash flow projections
   - Total cumulative cash flows
   - Average annual cash flow
   - Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)

#### **Bonds Mode**
1. **Bond Pricing**: Enter bond parameters and click "Calculate Bond Price"
   - **Face Value**: Par value of the bond (default: $1,000)
   - **Coupon Rate**: Annual coupon rate as percentage
   - **Required Yield**: Market yield/discount rate as percentage
   - **Years to Maturity**: Time until bond matures
   - **Payments per Year**: Frequency (2 for semi-annual, 1 for annual)

2. **YTM Calculation**: Click "Calculate YTM" and enter current market price
   - Calculates yield to maturity from market price
   - Determines if bond trades at premium, discount, or par
